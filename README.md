# Personal-Menu
FiveM ESX Script

Hey Today I present a simple script that shows users a menu with the most common things.


It is completely configurable and comes with a small tutorial to add more things to the menu.

All the lines that you must change and a pack with the resources that I am using for this menu on my current server are also commented.

Requirements.zip ->

fs_taxi with voice (InteractSound)  
esx_hud (InfamesHUD)
SimpleCinematic  -> https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-simple-cinematic/675914
 

I hope it is useful to you
